Otto's DIY is a prototyping ecosystem for Eurorack style synthesizer modules. The project offers prototyping PCB panels, component kits and design documentation for different projects. All of the designs are free and open-source available in the [Otto's DIY Repository](https://github.com/intechstudio/ottosdiy/).

### Eurorack power supply module

The user contributed projects are showcased on the [Intech Studio](https://intech.studio/p/?&page=Ottos) website and discussed in the [Otto's DIY Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ottosdiy/).

I particularly enjoyed working on the project because it brings the synth DIY closer to each other. Writing the Otto's DIY Coockbook was also a lot of fun. As of now we have released [Vol. 1 The basics of analog design](https://github.com/intechstudio/ottosdiy/blob/master/Cookbook/Vol.%201/Otto's%20DIY%20-%20Cookbook%20(Vol.%201).pdf) which explains the inner workings of an Voltage Controlled Oscillator circuit through an easy to follow example.
