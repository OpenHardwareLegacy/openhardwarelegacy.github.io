title: "MPSRT - Remote Monitoring (IoT)"
categories: [Projects]

As part of the TMIT IOT Competition, 
I created MPSRT to overcome many difficulities that arise when we try to manage our desktop computers remotly. 
From teleworking or parental supervision to hardware health monitoring and two-factor authentication.

## Features

 * Built In WiFi for remote management
 * RFID module for authentication
 * Temperature sensor interface and fan controller
 * SD card interface for data logging
 * OLED display on the front-panel
 * USB 2.0 interface to mimic USB devices

This design offers an easy to use integrated solution that does not require 
technical knowledge for the setup or the operation. Since this is a purly hardware solution, 
it works with every desktop computer, regardless of the architecture and operating system.

I enjoyed working on the project because it combines a number of different thechnologies to create a 
versitile computer accessory. The modular design of the product allows features to be added and remove as required.
